* Introduction

WARNING: This is an article about my view on various window managers, it is /very/ biased.
WARNING(1): This article is a work in progress.

* Definition

Window managers manage windows. They control the appearance and behaviour of windows and how they are arranged.

* Window Managers
This is not a complete list. I have only written about ones that I have used in the past, or am interested in.


** Awesome
[[https://awesomewm.org]]

NOTE: this post is not sponsored by awesomewm.

Awesome could easily be considered the most powerful window manager[fn:1] on Linux, as with enough time and effort, the WM itself is capable of recreating many DE like functionalities.
You can have [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635625925748457482/930841155103490058/unknown.png][notification centers]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/rs0wm4/awesome_forest/][action centers]],  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/hpakeu/awesome_afternoon_in_a_perfect_world/][dashboards]], [[https://github.com/ner0z/dotfiles#shots][lock screens]], anything you can think of.

Want to make it look like windows? You can.
Want to make it look like MacOS? It's already been done.

It's window management is dynamic and equally good at both tiling and floating.
It has perhaps the most customizable titlebars of any window manager.

Your bar can be vertical, horizontal or a circle right in the middle of your screen.

It's widget system is also incredibly powerful in the right hands and the tight integration with the rest of the window manager makes it even more so.

[[https://blingcorp.github.io/bling/][bling]] is an awesomewm utility library that focuses on adding new layouts and modules that make use of the widget system, but primarily focus on the new window managing features.
It adds a lot of cool features like additional layouts, window swallowing, scratchpads, playerctl signals, a tab container, tag preview, task preview, an app launcher and a window switcher.

[[https://github.com/material-shell/material-awesome][material awesome]] is an almost complete desktop environment made with awesomewm following the material design guidelines with a performant mouse/keyboard workflow to increase daily productivity and comfort.

** Berry

[[https://berrywm.org]]

Berry is a small floating window manager written in C. It has a surprising amount of features, and probably is my favourite floating window manager.
Neat Features:
- Powerful command-line client, and can thus be controlled via shell scripts
- Extensive theming options with titlebars, window text and double borders

** Herbstluftwm
[[https://herbstluftwm.org]]

herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for the X window system. It is configured through =herbstclient=, so the config file is simply a shell script run at startup.
All configuration can be done via =herbstclient= and thus there is no need to restart the window manager.

** i3
https://i3wm.org/

i3 is the easiest and simplest window manager. It is perfect for beginners, but is powerful enough to even satisy power users. Although, if you plan to use i3, I reccomend that you use [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][i3-gaps]] instead, as it has a few more features. [[https://swaywm.org/][Sway]] is i3 for wayland, so it might be worth checking out too.

** Openbox
http://openbox.org

Openbox is a lightweight, powerful, and highly configurable stacking window manager with extensive standards support.

[[https://discord.com/channels/635612648934735892/904032811730763796/904033099581624390][This]] is a thread on the unixporn discord which goes quite deep into openbox and it is much more detailed than this article will ever be.
If you want to read the conversation from its very origin, [[https://discord.com/channels/635612648934735892/635625925748457482/904019724592103455][here]] you go.

A rundown of the points made:
- Openbox has a specific feature other wms probably don't have: pipemenus. Pipemenus are menus generated by external commands and let you do cool things like a system fetch in your menu, dynamic application menus, file manager or browser bookmarks, media control, processes, connected devices, clipboard menu, the list goes on. A big list can be found here: http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Pipemenus
- The theme specification for openbox is really well done, allowing for very granular control of your themes. 
- Mouse binds are also done extremely well, allowing for certain actions depending on what key you're holding, the mouse button, and specifically the context of the bind
- There's also support for key-chain binds similar to emacs.

** XMonad
https://xmonad.org/

XMonad is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured in Haskell. It is full of features, and is very good at moving windows around. Although, as it is configured in haskell, it may take a while to get started and to get used to it. But if you're actually interested in the concept, dont let the language stop you.

[fn:1] SirAiedal: Technically, Awesome does not fit a list of "window managers". It is a window manager framework.
Or "runtime + set of libraries".
