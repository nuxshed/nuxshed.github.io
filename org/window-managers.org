* Introduction

WARNING: This is an article about my view on various window managers, it is /very/ biased.
WARNING(1): This article is a work in progress.

* Definition

Window managers manage windows. They control the appearance and behaviour of windows and how they are arranged.

* Window Managers
This is not a complete list. I have only written about ones that I have used in the past, or am interested in.


** Awesome
[[https://awesomewm.org]]

Awesome could easily be considered the most powerful WM in Linux as with enough time, the wm itself is capable of recreating many DE like functionalities
You can have [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635625925748457482/930841155103490058/unknown.png][notification centers]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/rs0wm4/awesome_forest/][action centers]],  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/hpakeu/awesome_afternoon_in_a_perfect_world/][dashboards]], [[https://github.com/ner0z/dotfiles#shots][lock screens]] , anything you can think of.

It's window management is dynamic and equally good at both tiling and floating
With perhaps the most customizable titlebars of any window manager.

It's widget system is also incredibly powerful in the right hands and the tight integration with the rest of the window manager makes it even more so.

Switch to awesome now. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0][just do it.]]

** Berry

[[https://berrywm.org]]

Berry is a small floating window manager written in C. It has a surprising amount of features, and probably is my favourite floating window manager.
Neat Features:
- Powerful command-line client, and can thus be controlled via shell scripts
- Extensive theming options with titlebars, window text and double borders

** Herbstluftwm
[[https://herbstluftwm.org]]

herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for the X window system. It is configured through =herbstclient=, so the config file is simply a shell script run at startup.
All configuration can be done via =herbstclient= and thus there is no need to restart the window manager.

** i3
https://i3wm.org/

i3 is the easiest and simplest window manager. It is perfect for beginners, but is powerful enough to even satisy power users. Although, if you plan to use i3, I reccomend that you use [[https://github.com/Airblader/i3][i3-gaps]] instead, as it has a few more features. [[https://swaywm.org/][Sway]] is i3 for wayland, so it might be worth checking out too.
